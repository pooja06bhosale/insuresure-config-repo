 Config Repo is a central place (usually a Git repository)
 where you store all the configuration files (.yml or .properties) for your microservices,
 instead of keeping them inside each service’s application.yml or application.properties.


 ✅ Simplifies CI/CD
 When deploying, services just pull their config from Config Server.
 No need to manage configs in each service's build.

 📦 Config Repo (Git) → 📡 Config Server (Spring Cloud Config) → 📱 Microservices
 ✔️ Microservices at startup connect to Config Server via bootstrap.yml
 ✔️ Config Server fetches configs from the Git repo (Config Repo)
 ✔️ Config Server sends configs to microservices
